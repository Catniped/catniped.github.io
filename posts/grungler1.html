    <p class="content">sometimes you just gotta compensate. which is exactly what i did when i realised i would not be able to purchase a decent cnc mill to produce metal parts without financially undermining myself (this ended up not being true, and at the time of writing this the parts for my mill are on their way :3).<br><br>
      this lead me to start researching metal 3D printing (with a big budget concern in mind). at first i tried looking at how much a homemade SLM setup would cost me, and immediately abandoned that when i realised that i would have to circulate fucking argon gas thru the chamber if i wanted to do it without blowing my whole house up, for which i definitely dont have the budget nor the capabilities to do. not even counting the pure cost of the laser in, which could easily make just the machine cost over 2k euro.<br><br>
      i didnt give up however, and studied every metal 3D printing method i could find. out of the many that exist, theres basically only 2 processes of which the raw cost is low enough for me to attempt:<br>
      1. binder jetting<br>
      2. electron beam melting<br><br>
      electron beam melting is a pretty interesting one, as the electron gun is a pretty cheap device to diy, compared a high power laser, which would remove a very significant part of the cost compared to SLM. however, thinking about the 20kV you need to generate a sufficiently powerful beam, along with the ionizing radiation which such a device would emit, made me not a big fan of this process.<br><br>
      here is where binder jetting comes in. binder jetting, or 3DP as some call it, is a pretty amazing process, which involves using a inkjet printer printhead to place a liquid binder onto a powder bed, bonding the powder particles together into a desired 3D part. the best part is that, compared to other additive manufacturing processes, you can print basically anything, aslong as you find a powdered form of it and a suitable binder (or you can make your own).<br><br>
      now that i knew what process i can use to acomplish my task, it was time to design the machine, and solve all the little problems and steps along the way. huge thanks to Dragonator from <a href="https://ytec3d.com/">ytec3D</a>, as his <a href="">Oasis 3DP project</a>, along with all the other resources provided by them and the ytec3D forum, were some of the most helpful things i could have ever asked for. i also saved a ton of money on the printhead thanks to them selling <a>HP45 connectors on tindie</a>, so i didnt have to buy a bulk amount of them from the manufacturer.
