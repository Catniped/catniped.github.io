    <p class="content">there are a few different types of atomization furnaces, like gas, water and plasma, but due to costs and difficulty i chose to build a centrifugal atomization furnace. this process uses a high rpm spinning disc (all the way up to 60k rpm, more is difficult, ill likely be using 24k) to atomize a melt of metal poured on top from a furnace. this method produces slightly larger average particle size than gas or water atomization, however ball milling can be used to grind the particle size down if we need a smaller one. gas and centrifugal atomization can be paired to produce very small average particle sizes.
    <br><br>in my design, i intend to use an induction heater to melt the metal, and a cnc machine spindle with a vfd to spin the atomizer disc. these can reach very high rpms, making them perfect for this purpose. i intend on using a plc for controlling the machine, as i have been getting into industrial automation engineering recently, and would like to give this project a proper electrical cabinet. there are many variables to control here, like the temperature of the disc, kiln pressure, atmosphere, ...
    <br><br>this is a very big and expensive project, and i would like to do it as research. the future of this project is uncertain as of now.
