    <p class="content">at the time of writing, this project started about a year ago (fall 2023). it has grown and branched off vastly since i started, which is the reason why it is taking me so long to design a simple printer. 
    <br><br>in the beginning, i simply wanted to fork dragonator's Oasis binder jetting printer, making a few tweaks to make it cheaper or neater. however, my focus has shifted since, towards creating a well integrated ecosystem and workflow encompassing all the steps of creating a part using binder jetting, starting at the powder (or possibly even raw stock! check out <a href="atomization.html">the atomization furnace</a>), and ending at post-processing (sintering, tumbling). you can read about the specific machines/subprojects in detail in other articles on this site, but here is a summary of the workflow and covered steps:

    </p><div style="text-align:center; font-size:1.7vw; font-family: Poppins; -webkit-text-fill-color:rgb(195, 195, 195);">
        <i><a href="atomization.html">atomization</a> -> <a href="metallurgy-devices.html">mixing/ball milling</a> -> <a href="">printing</a> -> <a href="">curing/depowdering</a> -> <a href="metallurgy-devices.html">sintering</a> -> <a href="metallurgy-devices.html">tumbling/finishing</a></i></div>
    <br>

    <p class="content">the printer itself is gonna be quite similar to oasis, as it is using the same printhead. however, there will be improvements in mechanics (more stable/ballscrew z, more compact belt/motor configurations, an improved frame), and more importantly, software. as mentioned earlier, i aim to create a highly integrated workflow, without hacky steps (converting STLs to slices using STL to SVG in slic3r in original oasis workflow), and more alike to the workflow one may know from conventional hobbyist FDM 3D printing. this will be achieved via a custom slicer, and plugins for the Duet 3 board i will be using to control the printer. everything will fit inside a gcode file, and be manageable through the nice UI provided by Duet and custom DSF plugins.
        <br><br>update (fall 2025): i am working on this now as a research project to eventually produce a paper to be submitted to some competitions. ive discovered i would much rather spend my money on things other than perfecting simple cnc machines, and ive realised i can convert my cnc mill (same gantry type as oasis) into a simple binder jetting printer for barely any money. ive recently gotten the printhead working, i have access to a proper metallurgy lab now, and i have done significant work on the slicer over the summer (slicing and bin packing are practically finished). ive been very lazy but things are still looking up for this project, hopefully i can finally get off my ass and finish the printer soon!
